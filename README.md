# ColorHero
ColorHero is a platformer where you first build the level, then play it. 

# Building the level
You build the level by dragging to create blocks. You can create blocks in 7 different colors, although your "hero" can only step on colors it has unlocked. To make a color unlockable, click on the circle in the bottom right corner and then click to place the circle. Move your hero into the circle and then it can step on whatever color it has unlocked. Click on the square in the bottom left to go back to building platforms.

# Playing
It's a platformer, so jump on the blocks. The boxes on top will tell you which colors you've unlocked. Unlock all colors to win. Bonus fact: you can double jump.
